# InChI unofficial repository

This is just a fork of the [InChI library official repository](https://github.com/IUPAC-InChI/InChI) where I work on my changes before submitting them as PRs

As such, there should be no need to use it unless you want to test some specific work in progress or artifact before it lands upstream
